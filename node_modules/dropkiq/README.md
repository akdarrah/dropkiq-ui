DropkiqUI works with the Dropkiq Engine in order to provide inline Liquid suggestions as users write Liquid documents.

The Dropkiq Engine can be found here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/dropkiq. The engine is responsible for processing the text, caret position, and schema of the application to make suggestions as the user types. The DropkiqUI (contained in this repository) is responsible for rendering the UI so that users may see those suggestions.

The DropkiqUI has been tested in all major browsers and works with standard text input, textarea, and contenteditable fields.
